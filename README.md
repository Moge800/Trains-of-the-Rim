# Trains of the Rim

## Overview

Trains of the Rim revolutionizes your colony's bulk transportation options by introducing a railway vehicle system. Trains can efficiently move large quantities of cargo and passengers across vast distances. However, your colony must pay the upfront cost of labor-intensive rail infrastructure to gain the long-term benefits of massive cargo capacity and significant fuel efficiency. This mod aims to offer trains as an early industrial vehicle option while still remaining relevant in mid-to-late game colonies as a fuel efficient way to meet bulk trading and transportation needs.

## Railway Vehicles
- 8 different rail cars including boxcar, caboose, flatbed, flatbed with stakes, gondola, hopper, passenger car, and tanker
- 3 different locomotives including a small diesel electric, a small steam tank engine, and a heavy steam locomotive
- Steam locomotives can be researched early after Smithing, but these burn wood logs as fuel and are less efficient than chemfuel locomotives that can be researched after Biofuel Refining and Machining
- Steam locomotives have variants for either using wood or chemfuel
- You can cycle between alternate textures for wood, coal, or chemfuel burning locomotives depending on which texture you prefer

## Caravans
- Trains use the Vehicle Framework caravan system
- Trains may only travel along railroads on the world map
- Rail car "vehicles" can move without fuel and do not require a driver, but the rail cars cannot form a train caravan without a fuel burning locomotive
- Currently each additional rail car in a caravan needs a pawn passenger due to a Vehicle Framework bug with autonomous vehicles joining caravans

## Railroad Building
- Build railroads (and normal roads) using mechanics based on the road building system in Vanilla Factions Expanded: Classical (very thankful for the generous permission from Oskar Potocki to reuse some VFE: Classical C# code!)
- Send a caravan to a tile and choose a road type to build to a neighboring tile. This doesn't use any resources, but takes a lot of time, particularly for railroads. The more pawns in the caravan, the faster it will be built.
- Railroad building requires researching Steam Locomotives and stone roads require researching Stonecutting.
- Built-in compatibility if you also use VFE: Classical
- Planned compatibility for Rails and Roads of the Rim
- New rail assets buildable on the colony-map, inspired by Decorative Railway Props

## Train Pathing
- Train vehicles can be linked together. Currently they do not automatically move together, but you can still use right click and drag to position the individual drafted train vehicles as a group.
- Linked train vehicles can be recalled to a saved position similar to the Defensive Positions mod
- Train vehicles returning to the colony map from a caravan will automatically return to their saved position
- Optional experimental feature for requiring special railroad terrain to be built in order for train vehicles to move. This is experimental mainly due to some pathfinding quirks within Vehicle Framework when the Full Vehicle Pathing mod option is enabled which it is by default. You can disable Full Vehicle Pathing in the mod settings for Vehicle Framework, but this causes some different movement quirks.

## Future Plans
- Adjust gameplay balance and textures based on feedback.
- Work on vehicle pathing to have railway vehicles follow the lead locomotive
- Additional locomotives including a classic 19th century 4-6-0 steam locomotive, a streetcar trolley, and Derail Valley's DM3 and DE6.
- Additional rolling stock and cargo texture options like steel in hopper cars or wood logs on staked flatbeds.
- Add guidance for creating custom locomotives and railcars
- Possibly increasing quantity of bulk goods available at nearby settlements if connected in a rail network.
